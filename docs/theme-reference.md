title: Theme reference
description: Every theme field with its type, default, limits and validation rules, plus the values of the built-in themes.
---

## File format

A theme is a JSON file with comments allowed. glowup accepts `//` line comments and `/* */` block comments. Trailing commas are not allowed.

| Rule | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Location | `~/.claude/glowup/themes/<name>.json`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/glowup/themes/` when that variable is set |
| Extension | Only files that end in `.json` are read |
| Theme name | The file name without `.json`. The `name` field is used only by `/glowup theme add`. |
| Size limit | 65536 bytes (64 KB) |
| Top level | Must be a JSON object |
| Unknown top-level keys | Ignored |

A file in the folder with the name of a built-in theme replaces that theme for you.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | none | The name `theme add` saves the file under. Lowercase letters, digits and dashes, 1 to 40 characters, starting with a letter or digit. Not a built-in name. |
| `extends` | string | none | Name of the theme to build on. See [The extends chain](#the-extends-chain). |
| `colors` | object | `classic` colors | Colors by key. Each value is `#rrggbb`. |
| `spinner.words` | array of strings | `["Thinking"]` | Words for the spinner. See [Spinner words](#spinner-words). |
| `glyphs` | object | `classic` glyphs | One glyph per tool kind. |
| `band.hearts` | array of two strings | `["♥", "♡"]` | The full and empty heart in the context meter. |

## Colors

Every value must match `#rrggbb`: a hash and six hex digits, upper or lower case. Short forms like `#fff` are refused. An unknown key is an error: `unknown color "<key>"`. A bad value is an error: `color "<key>" must be #rrggbb`.

| Key | Used for in 0.1.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `accent` | The current plan item, plan progress pips, plan glyphs |
| `text` | Main text |
| `dim` | Secondary text, separators, empty hearts, files that were only read |
| `faint` | Empty parts of bars, the status box border, tree lines |
| `read` | Read and search rows, running subagent work, low context |
| `edit` | Edit rows, medium context, the context warning |
| `shell` | Shell rows |
| `agent` | Subagent rows |
| `pass` | Passing tests, finished subagents, added-line counts |
| `fail` | Failures, full hearts, high context, removed-line counts |
| `panel` | Accepted and checked. Not drawn in 0.1.0. |
| `addBg` | Accepted and checked. Not drawn in 0.1.0. |
| `delBg` | Accepted and checked. Not drawn in 0.1.0. |
| `sel` | Accepted and checked. Not drawn in 0.1.0. |

The context meter color changes with use: `read` below 60%, `edit` from 60%, `fail` from 80%.

## Glyphs

Glyphs are the marks glowup adds to a tool row after the call finishes. The keys are `read`, `search`, `edit`, `shell`, `agent` and `plan`. A tool of any other kind gets no glyph.

Each glyph, and each heart, must be exactly one character in the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000 to U+FFFF) that is one cell wide. glowup refuses:

- Control characters (U+0000 to U+001F, U+007F to U+009F).
- Zero-width and bidirectional marks (U+200B to U+200F, U+2028 to U+202F, U+2060 to U+206F, U+FEFF).
- Surrogates (U+D800 to U+DFFF).
- Wide East Asian characters, which take two cells.
- Anything above U+FFFF, which includes emoji.

Errors: `unknown glyph "<key>"`, `glyph "<key>" must be one width-1 character`, `"glyphs" must be an object`, and `band.hearts must be two width-1 characters`.

## Spinner words

`spinner.words` is an array of strings. Each string can be at most 24 characters. glowup rejects a word that contains control, bidirectional or zero-width characters. An empty array is ignored and the parent's words stay. A bad value is an error: `spinner.words must be short strings`.

glowup picks one word at random at the start of each turn and uses it for the whole turn. A theme named `classic` keeps Claude Code's own rotating words, so `classic` ignores its words. With reduced motion on, every theme keeps Claude Code's word. glowup can change the word only; the spinner frames are Claude Code's.

## The extends chain

`extends` names another theme: a built-in, or a file in your themes folder. glowup resolves it like this:

1. It starts from the `classic` values.
2. It follows `extends` to the end of the chain, then applies the files from the root of the chain down to your theme.
3. Within each file, `colors` and `glyphs` replace only the keys they set. `spinner.words` and `band.hearts` replace the whole value.

A theme with no `extends` still starts from `classic`, so a partial file is always complete.

Every file in the chain is validated. Errors:

| Message | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `theme "<name>": no theme named "<other>"` | `extends` names a theme that does not exist. |
| `theme "<name>": "extends" loops: a -> b -> a` | The chain comes back to a theme already in it. |
| `theme "<name>": "extends" must be a theme name` | `extends` is not a string. |
| `theme "<name>": a theme must be a JSON object` | The file is not an object. |

When any of these happen, `/glowup theme <name>` prints the message and keeps your current theme. At session start, glowup shows the message and uses `classic`.

## Built-in themes

`classic` is the default theme. `glowup`, `aurora`, `dusk`, `cyberpunk`, `vaporwave` and `high-contrast` extend `classic`. They set all 14 colors. All of them except `high-contrast` set spinner words.
