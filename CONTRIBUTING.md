# Contributing to glowup

## Setup

Run `just --list` to see the dev commands. Each recipe wraps one of these:

```sh
pnpm install # just setup
pnpm check   # just check: `claude plugin validate` and tsc
pnpm test    # just test: `claude plugin test .`
```

You need Node 24, pnpm, just, and Claude Code 2.1.289 or later. To run the mod in a live session from your clone:

```sh
claude --plugin-dir .   # just dev
```

The session watches the folder and reloads the mod when you save a file.

## Branches and pull requests

- Branch off `main`. One change per branch.
- Every PR is squash merged. The PR title becomes the commit subject, so write it in the commit grammar below.
- Sign off every commit (`git commit -s`).
- No `Co-Authored-By` or tool-attribution trailers.

## Commit grammar

`type(scope): imperative subject`, under 60 characters.

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`. Scope is the area: `build`, `themes`, `events`, `model`, `changes`, `layout`, `band`, `pane`, `agents`, `wiring`, `statusline`, `restyle`, `commands`, `release`, `docs`, `docket`, `ci`.

The body says what changed and why. It does not narrate how the answer was found.

## Mod rules

- A hook imports only its own files and `claude-code`.
- `$` is used only in `hooks/register.tsx`.

## Themes

A theme is a data-only JSON file. It holds no code and nothing in it is executed. Every color is written as `#rrggbb`.

To submit one, open a theme submission issue with the JSON file and a screenshot, or open a PR that adds the file.

## Gates

CI runs `pnpm check` and `pnpm test` on every PR.

## Testing for runaway processes

Once, glowup's status line script called itself and started shells until the machine ran out of memory. A mod that writes shell or settings can do that, so test it for real.

**The two-copies trap.** An installed glowup plus `just dev` loads glowup twice, and each copy has its own store. Disable one before you test: `claude plugin disable glowup@glowup`.

**Run a dev session safely.** Use a throwaway config dir and a process cap:

```sh
ulimit -u 500
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$(mktemp -d) just dev
```

`ulimit -u` counts every process you own, so pick a number above what you already run (`ps -u $USER --no-headers | wc -l`).

**Watch it.** In a second terminal:

```sh
watch -n1 'pgrep -c sh; free -h | head -2'
ps -eo ppid,comm | awk '{n[$1" "$2]++} END {for (k in n) if (n[k] > 20) print n[k], k}'
```

A `sh` count that climbs while you do nothing, or one parent with dozens of children, is a loop. Kill it with `pkill -f glowup/statusline.sh`.

**What `test/statusline-script.check.ts` covers.** It writes the real generated script to a temp dir and runs it in `sh` with a hard 5 second kill. A fallback that calls the script itself must stop at once and never hold more than a handful of processes. A normal fallback must still print its output. It runs under `pnpm test` after the engine tests, because the engine's runner cannot start processes.

**Checklist for any change that writes shell or settings:**

- Never call yourself: a fallback or backup must not be your own script or command.
- Guard recursion in the generated script itself, not only in the code that writes it.
- Run the generated script in a real shell, with the bad input as well as the good one.
- Remember another copy of the mod may have written the file you are about to read.

## Releasing

Add entries under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` as you merge changes. To cut a release:

```sh
just release 0.1.0
git push --follow-tags
```

`just release` bumps `plugin.json` and `package.json`, dates the changelog section, then commits and tags. The pushed tag starts the release workflow, which checks the versions, runs `pnpm check` and `pnpm test`, and publishes the changelog section with the archives.

## Design changes

A new tab, a change to the theme file format, or anything that reads new data from the user's machine starts as an issue that states the design.

Decisions are recorded with [docket](https://github.com/NovusEdge/docket) in `.docket/`. Commit the ledger with the change it describes.

## Comments

A comment in code carries a fact the reader cannot get from the code. Paraphrase, investigation history, and section banners are deleted in review.

## Reporting a security issue
