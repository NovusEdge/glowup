title: Roadmap
description: What is planned for later releases, and ideas that are not planned yet.
---

What each release added is in the [changelog](https://github.com/NovusEdge/glowup/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Planned

None of these has a date, and the order can change.

- Sound and voice layers for packs. The pack file format already reserves the keys.
- More spinners.
- More pets: Kit and Blip.
- Import of iTerm2 color schemes.
- Opening an agent from the Agents tab to see its tool calls.
- Styling for the Claude desktop app.

Pack and theme files written for 0.2.0 or later will keep working.

## Ideas for Clawd

These are not planned yet, but each one depends only on events glowup can already see.

Outfits:

- Hard hat during a long build or install (`cargo build`, `pnpm install`, `docker build`).
- Detective hat and magnifier when a turn runs many searches.
- Headphones when a turn runs past five minutes.
- A crown when the test suite passes after earlier failures in the session.
- A bandage after three failed test runs in a row, off at the next pass.
- A graduation cap on the first commit in a new repository.
- Sunglasses on `git push --force`.
- A party horn from December 31 to January 1.
- A birthday cake on your install anniversary, beside the party hat.
- A clover on March 17.

Animations:

- Waving at session start and when you come back after he fell asleep.
- Eating a cookie when a turn finishes in under ten seconds.
- Sneezing when a command fails with "permission denied".
- Spinning in place when a retry works after a tool error.

Small touches:

- Weekday moods: slower on Monday, bouncier on Friday afternoon.
- A rare idle, about once a day, where he looks straight at you.
- Sparkles around him at a combo of ten or more.

## Ask for something

To suggest a feature, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/NovusEdge/glowup/issues). A change to the theme or pack file format starts as an issue that states the design. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repository.
